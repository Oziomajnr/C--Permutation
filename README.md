# C# Permutation

C# implementation of Heaps algorithm to help get all the posible permutation of an array of objects.

Heaps Algorithm can be found from its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap's_algorithm).

This implementation can  produce the permutation of the array of any type because it uses a generic implementation.

### How to use
To use, after you clone the project and compile, the dll is located in the folder `{Solution Folder}\Permutation\bin\Debug\Permutation.dll` if you built the project in debug mode or `{Solution Folder}\Permutation\bin\Release\Permutation.dll`

If however, you have built the project in release mode, after adding the dll you can now use the generic permutation class and the permutation method in the class to permutate an array of objects.
