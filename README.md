# C--Permutation
C# implementation of Heaps algorithm to help get all the posible permutation of an array of objects
Heaps Algorithm can be found from its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap's_algorithm).
This implementation can  produce the permutation of the arrray of any type because it uses a generic implementation
contributions are welcome. Cakes Up!
To use, after you clone the project and compile, the dll is located in the folder C--Permutation\Permutation\bin\Debug\Permutation.dll if you built the project in debug mode or C--Permutation\Permutation\bin\Release\Permutation.dll  if you build the project in release mode, after adding the dll you can now use the generic permutation class and the permutation method in the class to permutate an array of objects.
