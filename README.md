# C--Permutation
C# implementation of Heaps algorithm to help get all the posible permutation of an array of objects
Heaps Algorithm can be found from its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap's_algorithm).
This implementation can  produce the permutation of the arrray of any type because it uses a generic implementation
contributions are welcome. Cakes Up!
